squeakUserInterface	^'The Squeak UI has some unusual elements that you may not have seen before.  Here is a brief introduction to those elements:ProjectsA project is an entire Squeak desktop full of windows.  Projects can be used to change quickly from one task to another.  An inactive project is represented by a project window, which shows a thumbnail of its state.  Project windows are actually more like doors than windows, since you can enter the project just by clicking on them.  You can create a new project by choosing ''open...project'' from the screen menu.  To exit a project (and return to its parent project), choose ''previous project'' from the screen menu.  Each project maintains its own set of windows and other information.Morphic HalosIn a morphic project, pressing cmd-click (Mac) or alt-click (Windows) on a graphical object (e.g. a window) will surround it with a constellation of colored circles.  These are called "halo handles."  Additional clicks will cycle through the halos for the other graphical objects in the nesting structure.  If you hold down the Shift key while cmd/alt-clicking, the nested morphs will be traversed from innermost outward.  Clicking without the cmd/alt key will dismiss the halo.  While the halo is up, letting the cursor linger over one of the halo handles for a few seconds will cause a balloon to pop up with the name of that handle.  Three useful handles are the top-left "X" handle (delete), the bottom-right yellow handle (resize), and the brown handle (slide the object within its containing object).  Halos allow complex graphical objects to be explored - or even disassembled (using the black halo handle).  Usually no harm results from taking apart an object; you can just discard the pieces and create a new one.FlapsTo enable Flaps, click on the desktop to show the world menu, choose the "Flaps..." menu and "show shared tags". Tabs labeled "Squeak", "Tools", "Supplies", etc., will appear along the edges of the Squeak desktop.  Click on any tab to open the corresponding flap.  Drag a tab to resize the flap and to relocate the tab.  Bring up the halo on any tab and click on its menu handle to be presented with many options relating to the flap.  Use the "Flaps..." menu, reached via the desktop menu, to control which flaps are visible and for other flap-related options and assistance.Parts BinsYou can obtain new objects in many ways.  The "Objects Catalog" (choose "objects'' from the world menu or open the objects flap) and several of the standard flaps (e.g. "Tools" and "Supplies") serve as "Parts Bins" the for new objects.  Drag any icon you see in a Parts Bin and a fresh copy of the kind of object it represents will appear "in your hand"; click to deposit the new object anywhere you wish.  You can also add your own objects to any of the flaps - just drag your object over the tab, wait for the flap to pop open, then drop the object at the desired position in the flap.!' readStream nextChunkText
