backTo: startIndex	"During typing, backspace to startIndex.  Deleted characters fall into three	 clusters, from left to right in the text: (1) preexisting characters that were	 backed over; (2) newly typed characters that were backed over;	(3) preexisting characters that	 were highlighted before typing began.  If typing has not yet been opened,	 open it and watch for the first and third cluster.  If typing has been opened,	 watch for the first and second cluster.  Save characters from the first and third	 cluster in UndoSelection.  Tally characters from the first cluster in UndoMessage's parameter.	 Delete all the clusters.  Do not alter Undoer or UndoInterval (except via	 openTypeIn).  The code is shorter than the comment."	| saveLimit newBackovers |	morph readOnly ifTrue: [^ self].	saveLimit := beginTypeInIndex		ifNil: [self openTypeIn.
